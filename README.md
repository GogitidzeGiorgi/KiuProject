# GoLang Interpreter

Welcome to the **GoLang Interpreter**, a Java-based interpreter that processes GoLang code provided as a string in the `main` method and interprets it. The interpreter supports several algorithms implemented in GoLang and demonstrates the ability to parse and execute them using Java.

---

## Project Description

This interpreter works by taking GoLang code as a string input and interpreting it using Java. It supports the following algorithms:

1. **Sum of First N Numbers**
2. **Factorial of N**
3. **GCD of Two Numbers**
4. **Reverse a Number**
5. **Check if a Number is Prime**
6. **Check if a Number is Palindrome**
7. **Find the Largest Digit in a Number**
8. **Sum of Digits**
9. **Multiplication Table**
10. **Nth Fibonacci Number**

## Run the project
   - Locate the GoLang algorithm file in the `Algorithms` folder (e.g., `sum_of_first_n.txt`).
   - Open the file and copy its contents.
   - Paste the code as the value of the `program` string in the `main` method of `Main.java`.
   - run
